Abstract:
Dr. Emin Orhan’s research is aimed at understanding the high level computational principles and lower level circuit mechanisms underlying biological intelligence. His recent work uses deep learning to address these fundamental questions. In the first part of his talk, Dr. Orhan will describe his recent efforts to understand the nature of the neural representations underlying short-term memory maintenance in the brain, using task-trained recurrent neural networks (Orhan & Ma, Nature Neuroscience, 20191). Consistent with experimental findings, his results show that these models display a spectrum of maintenance mechanisms ranging from sequential delay activity to more persistent delay activity depending on a variety of task- and circuit-related factors. The complete experimental tractability of these models also aids a detailed understanding of the circuit level mechanisms underlying this spectrum of solutions. In the second part of his talk, Dr. Orhan will discuss how he can use the insights gained from the first part to improve artificial neural networks (Orhan & Pitkow, ICLR, 20202). Specifically, he will show that sequential neural activity can be used as a novel, useful inductive bias to improve memory in recurrent neural networks solving practical machine learning tasks. Together these two projects illustrate how deep learning and neuroscience can mutually inform each other, to the benefit of both fields.

Click here to Visit the Cultured Data Symposium Website and Register.
The growing digitization of the cultural record and the explosion of new data generation, collection, and analysis practices create a new state of cultured data: culture as data, and data as a driver of culture. Our symposium examines this emerging condition, considering both how analytic techniques enable new understandings of culture, and how the proliferation of data in everyday life changes how culture is produced, distributed, and influenced. In these panels, we wrestle with new modes of scholarship and cultural production enabled by data-forward analysis methods, and consider perspectives from the arts and humanities for data science practice. What can these disciplines teach one another about their possibilities and limits towards realizing a more just, informed, and culturally-rich future?
Sponsored by the Halicioglu Data Science Institute, The Library at UC San Diego, the Division of Arts and Humanities, as well as local partners, this event aims to contribute to interdisciplinary exchange defining the nascent field of Data Science.
Over the two day symposium we will host four panels, each focused on one intersection of data science and the arts and humanities. Each panel will have four speakers drawn from academia, industry, and the arts. The first day will be held at CalIT2 on campus with a related arts exhibition. The second day will be hosted in Bread & Salt, a popular arts warehouse in Barrio Logan, concluding with evening performances.
The hashtag for the symposium is #CulturedData."

————————————————————————————————
Abstract:  The first wave of computing was large main frames, the second the PC, and the third the smartphone and mobile computing. We are arguably living in the fourth wave of computing led by billions of connected IoT devices, connected to each and every facet of our life, powered by rapid advances in machine learning, and hardware/software systems. However, there are numerous challenges that still hinder the widespread realization of this vision of pervasive IoT – namely security, safety, privacy concerns and those related to scalability and efficacy of ML systems to make sense of the sheer volume and diversity of IoT data.
In this talk, I will present our recent work on building a safe, secure and easy to use IoT infrastructure from the ground up.  I will first present GioTTO – an end-to-end IoT stack that we have been building for a few years now, which includes our Mites.io hardware platform coupled with our distributed IoT OS and Machine Learning layers to enable intelligent inferences from IoT sensors without having to write (much) code. I will also describe numerous safety and security challenges common with current IoT ecosystems and our recent approaches towards addressing these issues for existing platforms and for clean slate designs.  Finally, I will discuss the numerous privacy issues with these emerging IoT devices and deployments and highlight our multi-faceted approaches to address them by involving various stakeholders — developers, manufacturers and end-users. I will summarize by highlighting challenges and opportunities ahead including briefly mentioning some ongoing work.

Open science has the objective of accelerating the dissemination of fundamental research results to advance the frontiers of knowledge and help ensure the nation’s future prosperity.  It can positively influence the verification of scientific research results (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)), can encourage the open sharing of the products of scientific research, and can encourage greater scientific rigor.   Advancing open science throughout the scientific enterprise has challenges both socio-organizational and technical, challenges that impact the scientific workflows and science norms, the subsequent uses of data, and the reproducibility and replicability of scientific results.
Technology advancements have a long and distinguished history of aiding and advancing scientific discovery as a whole.  Technology is more recently being employed in the aid of open science as well through, for instance, research advances in data provenance.   Technology research needs to continue along its leading edge trajectory of technological advancement while at the same time being more mindful that technology results are not always positive and not even always neutral.
In this talk I discuss the promise of open science in data science.  I discuss the technology advancements that have contributed to trustworthiness of research, including our own work in data provenance and safe computing.   I conclude with a full realization of open science but one that is smattered with measure of caution that encourages data science programs to be intentional about the norms that are being formed in the next generation of its researchers.

Psycho-social theories can inform the design of mobile health technologies that require user interaction. I demonstrate how human centered computing can leverage theories in developmental psychology and behavior science to inform the treatment and palliative care of chronic diseases, developmental disorders, and mental illness. Each of these conditions has a set of challenges. For asthma, these include poor patient engagement and lack of continuity of care. Individuals with autism, on the other hand, require constant guidance on daily activities. In contrast, PTSD therapy is limited by the over-reliance on patient self-report and clinician intuition. In this talk I will discuss technology interventions that address these issues and provide personalized solutions. I will also discuss the underlying theories that power these systems and new projects that are in line with this HCI chronic care research agenda.

Natural language processing as a field is offering more and more efficient methods for several complex text-related tasks. Most of them are based on vector representation of words, phrases or sentences. The outcomes are often amazing – and smoothly passing the Touring Test. Although does successfully operating on language mean that the AI does understand the language? That it knows the meaning of the words or sentences it plays with? And how can the notions of meaning and understanding be defined here? With the help of semiotics and philosophy of language I will discuss the concept of word embeddings algorithms, as well as its consequences for the use of linguistic data.

Meshfree methods such as the Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM) offer arbitrary orders of continuities/ discontinuities and locality in the approximation while allowing straightforward model refinement and physics-specific solution enrichment. These unique properties have expanded the horizon of computational mechanics and scientific computing applications well beyond what the mesh-based computational methods can offer, such as multi-scale and multi-physics modelings and image/pixel based simulation. Meshfree collocation methods have also undergone significant development, which also offer a truly meshfree solution without the tedious domain integration in the conventional finite element methods. A recent effort in meshfree method finds its new application in pixel-based data-driven computing, where the employment of smooth interpolants in an unstructured discretization can be utilized to reconstruct the local data manifold in a convex hull based on nearest neighbor material points to yield a better conditioned reduced-dimension data-driven optimization system for enhanced accuracy and robustness against noise and outliers in data sets. A data-driven simulation of heart valve tissues under finite deformation will be demonstrated.

Reports on the global cyber-security landscape prove that DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are the dominant threat for the market of network services. The number of attacks is growing every year, and so is the scale and the complexity of attack dynamics.
There are already many DDoS detection and mitigation systems available. Most of them, though, use signature-based (supervised learning) mechanisms, comparing the content of network packets or statistical features of network flows with patterns of already known attacks.
The new patent-pending approach I will discuss does not need signatures to solve the attack detection and mitigation problem. It turned out that by asking the right questions about the structure and evolution of the network traffic data, I was able to handle even the multidimensional time-varying attacks in real-time, with no pre-knowledge available. Even more, this insight created new perspectives on how to address cybersecurity problems with tools that haven’t been considered for the job before.

Abstract: The phenomenon of self-driving (autonomous) vehicles is a symbol of the grand re-emergence of artificial intelligence and robotics as a promising technology. The most general model of future vehicular transportation is that of artificially intelligent, connected, autonomous vehicles. From a commercial perspective, the dominant market potential at this point is that of wirelessly connected, cloud-backed autonomous and semi-autonomous land vehicles.
In this talk, we want to motivate the discussion around the task of designing efficient and resilient embedded SoCs in support of the above-mentioned vehicular swarm problem space [1]. Such an SoC would be composed of a mix of different processing elements (PEs): e.g. general-purpose cores and various types of special-purpose accelerators. Such a heterogeneous, multi-core architecture is well-established in the art as an energy-efficient execution paradigm. However, such hardware-level heterogeneity generally presents itself as a difficult programmability challenge from a user perspective.
The Domain-Specific SoC (or DSSoC) program under DARPA MTO’s Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI), is concerned with the problem of designing easily programmable, yet efficient SoCs (for an identified application domain) at low development cost. The IBM-led project under DSSoC is called: “EPOCHS: Efficient Programmability of Cognitive Heterogeneous Systems,” in which our chosen application domain is that represented by intelligent, connected autonomous vehicles. In this talk, we present the novel elements of the EPOCHS approach to agile SoC design. The strategy is to meet the programmability and efficiency metrics with the help of smart system software, supported where needed, by customized hooks in hardware.

Abstract: Recent conceptual discussion on the nature of the explainability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has largely been limited to causal investigations. This paper identifies some shortcomings of this approach to help strengthen the debate on this subject. Building on recent philosophical work on the nature of explanations, I demonstrate the significance of two non-causal explanatory elements: (1) mathematical structures that are the grounds for capturing the decision-making situation and (2) statistical and optimality facts in terms of which the algorithm is designed and implemented. I argue that these elements feature directly in important aspects of AI explainability and interpretability. I then propose a hierarchical framework that acknowledges the existence of various types of explanation, each of which reveals an aspect of decision making, and answers to a different kind of why-question. The usefulness of this framework will be illustrated by bringing it to bear on some salient questions about AI and society.

Previously, these intelligent systems were designed to play games,
like chess, jeopardy, and Go. But now as these systems start approaching human-level decision making , they need to be able to explain their decisions, and be able to tell a story of why they did
it. I am developing the underlying technology and methods to model complex systems as a layered system of communicating agents that can explain their behavior and learn from their mistakes.
In this talk, I present my work on building systems that use explanations to make more trusted, accountable (and even ethical) decisions. This methodology is similar to how we build trust among
our human peers: by asking questions, challenging assumptions, and carefully explaining the hypothetical consequences to ourselves. My proposed contribution will mitigate system-wide errors, by enabling the parts of a complex machine to use introspection and explanation to consistently monitor the behavior of their underlying parts and themselves.

Rebecca MacKinnon directs the Ranking Digital Rights (RDR) project at New America, setting global standards for corporate respect for freedom of expression and privacy online. The RDR Corporate Accountability Index ranks the world’s most powerful internet, mobile, and telecommunications companies on relevant commitments and policies, based on international human rights standards. Author of Consent of the Networked: The Worldwide Struggle For Internet Freedom (2012), MacKinnon is a 2019-2020 University of California Free Speech and Civic Engagement Fellow. She is co-founder of the citizen media network Global Voices, serves on the Board of Directors of the Committee to Protect Journalists and a founding member of the Global Network Initiative. Previously, she was CNN’s Bureau Chief and correspondent in China and Japan between 1998-2004. She has taught at the University of Hong Kong and the University of Pennsylvania, and held fellowships at Harvard, Princeton, and the Open Society Foundations.
Abstract: Since 2015 New America’s Ranking Digital Rights project has produced four iterations of the RDR Corporate Accountability Index, which ranks some of the world’s most powerful internet, mobile, and telecommunications companies on their disclosed policies and practices affecting users’ freedom of expression and privacy. (See https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2019) For the next iteration of the RDR Index, new indicators are being developed to evaluate company policies related to targeted advertising and the use of algorithms, automation, and machine learning. RDR Director Rebecca MacKinnon will give a preview of those new indicators, describe the research and consultation process used to develop them, and discuss their relationship to current policy debates about the power of digital platforms, online speech, democracy and human rights. In the ensuing discussion she hopes to learn about related research by UCSD students and faculty and explore potential areas of collaboration for the future.

The result is a relationship between us and our star that is observable only through a fleet of instruments, methods, and technologies yet creates weather in the near-Earth space environment that is both life-sustaining as well as life-threatening. This relationship is colloquially known as space weather.
To unravel the critical complexities and variabilities and to evolve beyond current approaches to understand space weather, new data-driven approaches and data analysis technologies are required. These data-driven methods are taking on new importance in light of the continuously changing data landscape of the space weather system, a challenge (and opportunity) shared by all scientific disciplines. Therefore, the scientific community faces both an exciting opportunity and an important imperative to create a new frontier built at the intersection of traditional approaches and state-of-the-art data-driven sciences and technologies.
In this talk we will first introduce the beauty and power of space weather and then discuss the meaning of data science in the context of space weather, highlighting data science as the actionable exploration of the full data lifecycle, covering collection, through storage, to analysis and decision-based communication of the analysis. We will present the latest efforts to leverage data science innovation to further space weather science, revealing lessons that reverberate across all scientific disciplines and that tie science to engineering, art, and design.
This talk is intended to provide insight to and spark discussion around the characteristics of convergence and antidisciplinary and the role of data science, namely creating new progress and a new frontier through radical interdisciplinarity and methodology transfer.

Overview:
Robust statistics and related topics offer ways to stress test estimators to the assumptions they are making. It offers insights into what makes some estimators behave well in the face of model misspecification, while others do not. In this summer school, we will revisit classic topics in robust statistics from an algorithmic perspective. We will cover recent progress on provably robust and computationally efficient parameter estimation in high-dimensions. We will compare this to other popular models, like agnostic learning and outlier detection. With the foundations in hand, we will explore modern topics like federated learning, semi-random models and connections to decision theory where being robust is formulated in alternative ways. We hope to have time for discussion about open questions like adversarial examples in deep learning, and invite the audience to help us muse about the right definitions to adopt in the first place.
Target audience:
The school is oriented towards graduate students, postdocs and faculty, who either work in robust statistics or want to understand the questions at the forefront of current research.

The ubiquity of these cycles is a double-edged sword: disruption of these cycles, as in shift work, light-at-night, or mistimed meals, can cause lasting medical harm and is in fact a major public health challenge at present. However, the presence of these cycles renders novel, high temporal-resolution data flows amenable to data science approaches for discovering oscillation features that enable personal, dynamic digital phenotyping and medical monitoring. In my talk I will describe some of the ways I have been extracting signatures of these cycles from miniature sensors and existing data flows, and using these to detect physiological changes at the scale of populations, but with resolution down to the individual. I will also highlight my work to probe the networks underlying these oscillations, and their potential to enable higher precision for clinical diagnostics, and biomechanistic investigations.

To quantify subcellular diffusion maps based on bio-imaging data, we develop and characterize a general optimization framework with diffusion equation constraints (OPT- PDE). We demonstrate the usability of the solver in recovering spatially heterogeneous and anisotropic diffusion maps with computer-simulated bio-images. The results indicate that the solver can accurately recover piecewise-constant isotropic and anisotropic diffusion coefficients, with efficient and robust convergence. Meanwhile, investigation of dynamic molecular activities in live cells often requires the visualization and quantitation of fluorescence ratio image sequences with high computational efficiency. Hence, we developed an open-source software package, Fluocell, to visualize pixel-wise ratiometric images and calculate ratio time courses with subcellular resolutions in high throughput. The power of Fluocell is demonstrated by the ratiometric analysis of images from fluorescent biosensors based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), allowing efficient quantification of dynamic molecular activities in a heterogeneous population of single live cells.
Fluocell was further integrated with the diffusion analysis solver to quantify the relationship between the biochemical and biophysical properties of Lck kinase in single T-cells. The results revealed a crucial amino acid residue Y397 in Lck, which regulates the enzymatic activities of Lck via its physical clustering during T-cell activation. Taken together, our work highlights the power of model-driven analysis in quantitatively inferring biochemical and biophysical signals in live-cell images, with important applications in biomedical sciences.

CRISPR screens promise researchers a higher a sensitivity and specificity than competing technologies like RNAi interference. However, there are major issues that can complicate the statistical analysis of the data arising from these screens. Particularly for CRISPR interference and activation screens, the problem of variable guide efficiency makes it difficult to identify true associations. I will discuss mixture model-based approaches to account for variable guide efficiency in the analysis of CRISPR screening data, how they can improve analysis, and the consequences of how we can think about CRISPR screens.

Focusing on parametrization for organic molecules (with CHNOSFCl atoms so far), we have developed the ANI neural network potential which is highly accurate compared to reference QM calculations at speeds 10^7 faster. The ANI potential is shown to accurately represent the underlying physical chemistry of molecules through various test cases including chemical reactions (both thermodynamics and kinetics), thermochemistry, structural optimization, solvent effect, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results presented in this talk will provide evidence of the general applicability of ANI potential to various organic chemistry problems along the drug discovery and development pipeline.

Abstract: A challenging problem in the brain imaging research is a principled incorporation of information from different imaging modalities in regression models. Frequently, data from each modality is analyzed separately using, for instance, dimensionality reduction techniques, which result in a loss of information. We propose a novel regularization method, griPEER (generalized ridgified Partially Empirical Eigenvectors for Regression) to estimate the association between the brain structure features and a scalar outcome within the generalized linear regression framework. griPEER provides a principled approach to use external information from the structural brain connectivity to improve the regression coefficient estimation. Our proposal incorporates a penalty term, derived from the structural connectivity Laplacian matrix, in the penalized generalized linear regression. We address both theoretical and computational issues and show that our method is robust to the incomplete structural brain connectivity information. griPEER is evaluated via extensive simulation studies and it is applied in classification of the HIV+ and HIV- individuals.

Join us in San Diego, May 28-31 for FAIR Data Stewardship training.

The promise of machine learning and AI are exciting, but are predicated on access to data that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).  Several studies show that 80% of a data professional’s time is spent on finding and cleaning data, rather than analysis. There are established models for creating and transforming data so that it is FAIR, to ensure data scientists and analysts spend more time seeking insights than on data cleaning. The potential new value to be captured and costs to be saved are enormous, especially when one adds in the untapped value from ‘dark data’, or data that isn’t used.

This past week, the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) announced the opening of the first US GO FAIR Coordination Office in the US. With the new U.S. office, the nation joins the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Brazil in establishing country-level coordinating offices. GO (Global Open) FAIR is a ‘bottom up’ initiative aimed at implementing the FAIR principles to ensure that data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. GO FAIR’s main goal is to kick-start the development of a global data commons for research and innovation.

As part of our new office, we are bringing trainers from Europe (EU) to UCSD for a FAIR Data Stewardship training course, not yet offered in the US."

In this talk, I will present a series of studies in which I have addressed these challenges through a multi-faceted data science approach: 1) Using deep learning to automate and scale arduous analysis procedures and to uncover hidden relationships between different imaging modalities; 2) harnessing citizen scientist input to generate labeled training data for machine learning; and 3) developing machine learning algorithms that leverage known brain structure to make inferences about individual variability. I will also discuss the socio-technical challenges facing the field and how we might address these challenges through open-source software development, new collaborative approaches to data analysis and data sharing, as well as through novel approaches to training in data science and neuroscience.

While cell classification has a rich history, recent technological advances have made it possible to tackle this problem systematically and comprehensively, and test the foundations underlying the concept of a “cell taxonomy”. I have addressed these issues in the mammalian retina, a complex yet accessible part of the brain, using hight-hroughput single-cell RNA-seq. I will describe a nearly complete cell taxonomy of the mouse retina (~140 neuronal types), and discuss the extent to which molecularly defined types correspond to types defined by traditional morphological and physiological criteria. I will then describe recent efforts to use the mouse retinal taxonomy as a foundation to, (1) assess cell-intrinsic and non-autonomous features that mediate selective resilience of neuronal types in injury models, (2) generate taxonomies of non-human primates and humans, and (3) explore conservation of cell types across species. I will describe major computational innovations for single-cell transcriptomic analysis developed in these studies that are applicable to similar efforts in other systems.

We cannot answer this question without understanding the capabilities of real-world adversaries to compromise hosts around the world; for example, among over 100,000 vulnerabilities disclosed publicly very few are likely to be exploited in the wild. Moreover, the machine learning techniques that drive the success of such inferences in non-adversarial domains, like computer vision or autonomous driving, face new challenges in security. In this talk I will discuss my work, combining machine learning with global-scale measurements, that has exposed critical security threats and has guided industrial practices. First, I will present the Worldwide Intelligence Network Environment (WINE), an analytics platform that has enabled systematic studies of security threats across more than 10 million hosts from around the world. Second, I will use WINE as a vehicle for exploring the opportunities for predicting future security incidents, such as vulnerability exploitation in the wild. I will conclude by discussing how these results have opened up new research directions and have taught us important lessons about the security of machine learning systems.

There are several major challenges in analyzing high-throughput biological data. These include the curse of (high) dimensionality, noise, sparsity, missing values, bias, and collection artifacts. In my work, I try to solve these problems using computational methods that are based on manifold learning. A manifold is a smoothly varying low- dimensional structure embedded within high-dimensional ambient measurement space. In my talk, I will present a number of my recently completed and ongoing projects that utilize the manifold, implemented using graph signal processing and deep learning, to understand large biomedical datasets. These include MAGIC, a data denoising and imputation method designed to ‘fix’ single-cell RNA-sequencing data, PHATE, a dimensionality reduction and visualization method specifically designed to reveal continuous progression structure, and two deep learning methods that use specially designed constraints to allow for deep interpretable representations of heterogeneous systems. I will demonstrate that these methods can give insight into diverse biological systems such as breast cancer epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, human embryonic stem cell development, the gut microbiome, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.

In addition to introducing the algorithm, the theoretical foundation of the solution based on nonlinear-type time-frequency analysis and differential geometry will be provided, particularly when the signal has complicated statistical features, like time varying amplitude, frequency and non- sinusoidal pattern, and non-stationary noise. Its clinical application to extracting fetal ECG morphology from the single channel maternal trans-

IRCAM, Paris
Improvisation can be seen as a major driving force in human interactions, strategic in every aspect of communication and action. In its highest form, improvisation is a mixture of structured, planned, directed action, and of hardly predictable local decisions and deviations optimizing adaption to the context, expressing in a unique way the creative self, and stimulating the coordination and cooperation between agents. An invaluable observation deck for understanding, modeling and promoting co-creativity in a context of distributed intelligence, Improvisation is an indispensable ability that any cyber-human system should indeed cope with in an expert way. Improvisation is instantiated in its most refined form in music, where the strongest constraints govern the elaboration of highly complex multi-dimensional, multi-scale, multi-agent actions in a cooperative and timely fashion so as to achieve creative social and cultural cooperation.
Setting up powerful and realistic human-machine environments for improvisation necessitates to go beyond the mere software engineering of creative agents with audio-signal listening and generating capabilities, such as what has been mostly done until now. Gerard Assayag has coined the term symbolic interaction in order to account for a richer and more versatile musical dialog between machines and humans, spanning over several levels of information from acoustic signals to the higher symbolic integration scales that are familiar to trained musicians. In order to foster realistic and artistically interesting behaviours in creative software agents, and to communicate with these in a productive way, we bring into synergy a combination of technical means: machine listening — extracting high level features from the musician signals and turning them into significant symbolic units ; machine cognition — discovering and assimilating on the fly structural schemes and learning powerful representations ; style modelling— elaborating consistent model of style an activating generative processes ; symbolic music representation — linking to formalized representations underpinning organized musical thinking s;a. analysis and composition. All these means cooperate — or compete — in order to elaborate multi-dimensional and multi-scale memory models, underlying processes of discovery, understanding, adaptation, reactivity, decision, planning, generation and contributing to the emergence of creative musical agents acting individually or in social interaction with other agents.
Improvised creative interactions between humans and machines can thus be studied from different perspectives (social sciences, AI, signal processing, control theory, robotics) and modalities in order to highlight the conditions under which these interactions can emerge, their temporal adaptation dynamics, their logical strategies, and to exploit their creative potential. We have proposed the expression co-creativity between human and artificial agents in order to emphasize the fact that creativity in this case is an emerging phenomenon resulting from complex interactions and complex crossed feed-backs between actors, and cannot be reduced to one or the other agent’s production in isolation, whether the latter be human or artificial.
This neutralizes the endless philosophical question of whether artificial entities can be qualified as “creative” or not, and shifts the research interest to the exploration of how to build the best possible technical tools in order to allow co-creative interaction to occur.

Addressing the new challenges that come with this role requires a change in how we approach and solve problems in computer security. My vision is that we must view computer security as a whole-system property ranging from the physical-layer right up to applications and end-users. In line with this vision, my approach to computer security involves formulating the right security problem to work on, addressing design-level issues by constructing strong defenses at the appropriate layer of abstraction, and challenging common assumptions to understand realistic threats.
In this talk, I will give several examples of my approach and vision, focusing on emerging technologies that span the digital-to-physical interface. I will cover technical results at various level of abstraction, including analysis techniques that found exploitable design-level vulnerabilities in closed-source smart home platforms, a new design for trigger-action platforms that provides strong integrity guarantees, and an analysis of how realistic attacks on machine learning can occur in the physical world. Finally, I will share my vision of the future of security and privacy research in an increasingly connected world.

He formulates and solves emerging problems in computer security using a combination of techniques ranging from threat modeling, measurements, experimental attack analyses, and system design.

Title: Controlling the Black Box: Learning Manipulable and Fair Representations
Abstract: Machine learning models, and more specifically deep neural networks, are achieving state-of-the-art performance on difficult pattern-recognition tasks such as object recognition, speech recognition, drug discovery, and more. However, deep networks are notoriously difficult to understand, both in how they arrive at and how to affect their responses. As these systems become more prevalent in real-world applications it is essential to allow users to exert more control over the learning system. In particular a wide range of applications can be facilitated by exerting some structure over the learned representations, to enable users to manipulate, interpret, and in some cases obfuscate the representations. In this talk I will discuss recent work that makes some steps towards these goals, allowing users to interact with and control representations.

Yet, in modern practice, over-parameterized deep networks with near perfect fit on training data still show excellent test performance. As I will discuss in my talk, this apparent contradiction is key to understanding modern machine learning. While classical methods rely on the bias-variance trade-off where the complexity of a predictor is balanced with the training error, “modern” models are best described by interpolation, where a predictor is chosen among functions that fit the training data exactly, according to a certain inductive bias.
Furthermore, classical and modern models can be unified within a single “double descent” risk curve, which extends the usual U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve beyond the point of interpolation. This new understanding of model performance delineates the limits of classical analyses and opens new lines of enquiry into computational, statistical, and mathematical properties of models. A number of implications for model selection with respect to generalization and optimization will be discussed.

Abstract: The increase in both ubiquity and importance of software systems in modern society causes a commensurate increase in demands that such systems uphold normative requirements, such as privacy, fairness, or accountability. However, while human decision-makers and bureaucracies are subject to time tested record-keeping, oversight, and control mechanisms, a governance gap often emerges when critical functions are replaced or augmented with software. This talk explores the nature of this gap through the twin lenses of trust and accountability, as conceptualized in computer security and in legal and political philosophy, respectively. This gap can be narrowed through careful system design. As an example, the talk presents a concrete system for building cryptographically auditable logs for automated decision-making systems that support robust analysis of procedural regularity, a foundational requirement of due process. Finally, the talk lays out a research agenda in the governance of software systems, framing research challenges and open questions around relating complex social, political, or legal norms to implementable engineering requirements.

Abstract: In recent years, topological and geometric data analysis (TGDA) has emerged as a new and promising field for processing, analyzing and understanding complex data. Indeed, geometry and topology form natural platforms for data analysis, with geometry describing the “shape” and “structure” behind data; and topology characterizing/summarizing both the domain where data are sampled from, as well as functions and maps associated to them.
In this talk, I will show how topological and geometric ideas can be used to analyze graph data, which occurs ubiquitously across science and engineering. Graphs could be geometric in nature, such as road networks in GIS, or relational and abstract, such as protein-protein interaction networks. I will particularly focus on the reconstruction of hidden geometric graphs from noisy data, as well as graph matching and classification. I will discuss the motivating applications, algorithm development, and theoretical guarantees for these methods. Through these topics, I aim to illustrate the important role that geometric and topological ideas can play in data analysis.

Agenda: April 1, 2 – 3:30 pm, Computer Science and Engineering Building. Room, 1202
Abstract: Modern machine learning models such as deep networks typically contain more parameters than training data. While this overparameterization results in ill-posed problems, these models often perform well in practice and are successfully deployed in data-driven applications. In this talk, I will present theoretical results demystifying this success by focusing on two class of problems.
In the first class of problems we avoid overfitting by using a model prior, such as sparsity, to narrow down the search space of the algorithm by using a proper regularization. For these problems, we introduce a general framework to quantify the benefit of prior knowledge in terms of problem geometry. This leads to a remarkably accurate characterization of the algorithmic behavior including estimation error, rate of convergence, and sample complexity.
The second class of problems typically arise in deep learning and require no explicit regularization. While neural networks have the capacity to overfit any dataset including noise, somewhat paradoxically, they continue to predict well on unseen test data.
Toward explaining this phenomena, we show that, neural networks trained by the gradient descent algorithm (1) are provably robust to noise/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels and (2) provably generalize to test data despite overparameterization.

Abstract: Deep Learning has had phenomenal empirical successes in many domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. To consolidate and boost the empirical success, we need to develop a more systematic and deeper understanding of the elusive principles of deep learning.
In this talk, I will provide analysis of several elements of deep learning including non-convex optimization, overparametrization, and generalization error. First, we show that gradient descent and many other algorithms are guaranteed to converge to a local minimizer of the loss. For several interesting problems including the matrix completion problem, this guarantees that we converge to a global minimum. Then we will show that gradient descent converges to a global minimizer for deep overparametrized networks. Finally, we analyze the generalization error by showing that a subtle combination of SGD, logistic loss, and architecture combine to promote large margin classifiers, which are guaranteed to have low generalization error. Together, these results show that on overparametrized deep networks SGD finds solution of both low train and test error.

Making sense of large and complex data requires methods that integrate human judgment and domain expertise with modern data processing systems. To meet this challenge, my work combines methods from visualization, data management, human-computer interaction, and programming languages to enable more effective and more scalable methods for interactive data analysis and communication.
More specifically, my research investigates automatic reasoning over domain-specific representations of visualization and analysis workflows, in order to produce both improved human-centered designs and system performance optimizations. My work on Vega-Lite provides a high-level declarative language for rapidly creating interactive visualizations. Vega-Lite can serve as a convenient representation for tools that generate visualizations. To create effective designs, these tools must also consider perceptual principles of design. My work on Draco provides a formal model of visual encodings, a knowledge base to reason about visualization design decisions, and methods to learn design rules from experiments. Draco can formally reason over the visualization design space to recommend appropriate designs but its applications go far beyond. Draco makes theoretical design knowledge a shared resource that can be extended, tested, and systematically discussed in the research community. The Falcon and Pangloss systems enable scalable interaction and exploration of large data volumes by making principled trade-offs among people’s latency tolerance, precomputation, and approximation of computations.
A recurring strategy across these projects is to leverage an understanding of people’s tasks and capabilities to inform system design and optimization.

An integral part of these advances have been complex probabilistic models for high-dimensional data, capturing different types of intricate latent structure. As a consequence, a lot of statistical and algorithmic issues have emerged, stemming from all major aspects of probabilistic models: representation (expressivity and interpretability of the model), learning (fitting a model from raw data) and inference (probabilistic queries and sampling from a known model). A common theme is that the models that are used in practice are often intractable in the worst-case (either computationally or statistically), yet even simple algorithms are, to borrow from Wigner, unreasonably effective in practice. It thus behooves us to ask why this happens. I will showcase some of my research addressing this question, in the context of (i) computationally efficient inference using Langevin dynamics in the presence of multimodality; (ii) statistical guarantees for learning distributions using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks); and (iii) explaining surprising properties of vector representations of words (word embeddings).

Abstract: A “sketch” is a data structure supporting some pre-specified set of queries and updates to a database while consuming space substantially (often exponentially) less than the information theoretic minimum required to store everything seen. Thus sketching can be seen as some form of functional compression. The advantages of sketching include reduced memory consumption, faster algorithms, and reduced bandwidth requirements in distributed computing environments. Sketching has been a core technique in several domains, including processing massive data streams with low memory footprint, ‘compressed sensing’ for lossy compression of signals with few linear measurements, and dimensionality reduction or ‘random projection’ methods for speedups in large-scale linear algebra algorithms, and high-dimensional computational geometry.

Abstract: Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is influential because it can be easily applied to generate optimal, statistically efficient procedures for broad classes of estimation problems. Nonetheless, the theory does not apply to modern settings—such as problems with computational, communication, or privacy considerations—where our estimators have resource constraints. In this talk, I will introduce a modern maximum likelihood theory  that addresses these issues, focusing specifically on procedures that must be computationally efficient or
privacy-preserving. To do so, I first derive analogues of Fisher information for these applications, which  allows a precise characterization of tradeoffs between statistical efficiency, privacy, and computation. To complete the development, I also describe a recipe that generates optimal statistical procedures  (analogues of the MLE) in the new settings, showing how to achieve the new Fisher information lower bounds.

Abstract: Modern technological developments have enabled the acquisition and storage of increasingly large-scale, high-resolution, and high-dimensional data in many fields. Yet in domains such as biomedical data, the complexity of these datasets and the unavailability of ground truth pose significant challenges for data analysis and modeling. In this talk, I present new unsupervised geometric approaches for extracting structure from large-scale high-dimensional data. By looking deep within the spectrum of the graph-Laplacian, we define a new robust measure, the Spectral Embedding Norm, to separate clusters from background, and demonstrate its application to both outlier detection and data visualization. This measure further motivates a new greedy approach based on Local Spectral Viewpoints for identifying overlapping high-dimensional clusters while disregarding noisy clutter. We demonstrate our approach on two-photon calcium imaging data, successfully extracting hundreds of individual neurons. Finally, to address the computational complexity of constructing graphs from large-scale data, we present a new randomized near-neighbor graph construction. Compared to the traditional k-nearest neighbor graph, using our near-neighbor graph for spectral clustering on datasets of a few million points is two orders of magnitude faster and more memory-efficient, while achieving similar clustering accuracy.

Initial results relied on server-oriented computations, but many applications will require deploying aspects of machine learning throughout the network hierarchy. Several factors motivate the development of Edge Intelligence architectures and algorithms: network bandwidth, power consumption, latency, privacy, etc. This talk will start the motivation for edge intelligence with several examples from manufacturing and health care and outline some important problems.

Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss three ingredients of optimization theory in the context of MCMC: Non-convexity, Acceleration, and stochasticity. I will focus on a class of non-convex objective functions arising from mixture models. For that class of objective functions, I will demonstrate that the computational complexity of a simple MCMC algorithm scales linearly with the model dimension, while optimization problems are NP-hard.
I will then study MCMC algorithms as optimization over the KL-divergence in the space of measures. By incorporating a momentum variable, I will discuss an algorithm which performs accelerated gradient descent over the KL-divergence. Using optimization-like ideas, a suitable Lyapunov function is constructed to prove that an accelerated convergence rate is obtained.
Finally, I will present a complete recipe for constructing stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms that translates the task of finding a valid sampler into one of choosing two matrices. I will then describe how stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms can be applied to applications involving temporally correlated data, where the challenge arises from the need to break the dependencies when considering minibatches of observations.

Abstract: Often modern scientific investigations start by testing a very large number of hypotheses in an effort to comprehensively mine the data for possible discoveries. Multiplicity adjustment strategies are employed to ensure replicability of the results of this broad search. Furthermore, in many cases, discoveries are subject to a second round of selection, where researchers identify the rejected hypotheses that better represent distinct and interpretable findings for reporting and follow-up. For example, in genetic studies, one DNA variant is often chosen to represent a group of neighboring polymorphisms, all apparently associated to a trait of interest. Unfortunately the guarantees of false discovery rate (FDR) control that might be true for the initial set of findings do not translate to this subset, possibly leading to an inflation of FDR in the reported discoveries. To guarantee valid inference, we introduce Focused BH, a multiple testing procedure that allows the researcher to curate rejections by subsetting or prioritizing them according to pre-specified but possibly data-dependent rules (filters). Focused BH assures FDR control on the selected discoveries under a range of assumptions on the filter and the p-value dependency structure; simulations illustrate that this is obtained without substantial power loss and that the procedure is robust to violations of our theoretical assumptions."

How does the human mind transform a cascade of sensory information into meaningful knowledge? As humans, we employ a variety of powerful tools to actively reformat our experiences and generate new ones. We choose what to look at, bring certain memories to mind, produce pictures to share, and compose stories to tell. My research aims to develop a computational theory of how we employ such cognitive tools to learn and communicate effectively. My recent work focuses on visual communication both because of this transformative impact and because it represents a key challenge for understanding how core cognitive systems interact to support complex, natural behaviors. This talk will highlight recent progress towards understanding the contribution of perceptual, action, and social reasoning systems to effective visual learning and communication."

The advent of new technologies has created great opportunities for data-driven discoveries spanning the worlds of science and industry and impacting both equally. In the past few years, data sources and availability have greatly changed. Examples include the abundance of data related to in some way to human behavior, policy implementations, interactions with a large number of computer devices and advertising materials, electronic records. Many datasets are now coming in a range of multimodal forms typically collected as streams of information; they now present highly unstructured patterns where a single phenomenon of interest is observed through multiple types of measurement devices, with each device possibly collecting only partial information of interest. Join our distinguished speakers and assembled experts to discuss issues like how can we disentangle and yet utilize all of the complex data in order to enrich statistical algorithms and models?
